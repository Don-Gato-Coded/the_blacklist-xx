These are some tutorials I have run through lately to keep my skill sharp / learn some new stuff during my Convalescence.

{{< youtube N93cTbtLCIM >}}
> LazyVim is a Neovim setup powered by ðŸ’¤ lazy.nvim to make it easy to customize and extend your config. 
> Rather than having to choose between starting from scratch or using a pre-made distro, LazyVim offers the best of both worlds - the flexibility to tweak your config as needed, along with the convenience of a pre-configured setup.
