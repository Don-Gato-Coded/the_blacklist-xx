    title="Frenchy's Fishing Dock."
    caption="During an earlier portion of the 1900s, this neon LUNCH sign was at Frenchy's Fishing Dock, located at the mouth of the Saginaw River (at the end of Shady Shore off of Patterson Road, in Bay County's Bangor Township). Recently, the sign's light mechanism was refurbished and the sign's patina (aged paint) was only cleaned, not repainted. The work was done by Rick Jacobs of Rickâ€™s Custom Neon Signs in Coleman, Michigan. Photos by Brian Miska.
