Stuff I find in  the local Detroit "liberal paper". The detroit Free Press.

    title="Lions win, 59-14!"
    caption="Here's a look at the front page from the Free Press 67 years ago on Dec. 30, 1957 — the day after the Detroit Lions [@detroitlionsnfl](https://www.threads.net/@detroitlionsnfl) won the [@NFL](https://www.threads.net/@nfl) title. The Lions famously had only one playoff win since that 1957 title — until last season, when they won twice: a 24-23 thriller over the Los Angeles Rams and 31-23 victory over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Both games were at home at Ford Field, their first home playoff games since 1993.
